abstract = {The rule of thumb that fishing mortality to achieve maximum sustainable yield (FMSY) equals natural mortality (M) has been both criticised and supported by theoretical arguments. However, the relationship has been rarely investigated using empirical data. We carried out a meta-analysis on 245 fish species worldwide and linked three types of reference points (FBRP: FMSY, Fproxy, and F0.5r) to M and other life history parameters (LHP). We used Bayesian hierarchical errors-invariables models to investigate the relationships and included the effect of taxonomic class and order. We compared various models and found that natural mortality is the most important LHP affecting FBRP. Other covariates, such as von Bertalanffy growth coefficient, asymptotic length, maximum age, and habitat types, add little to the relationship, partially because of correlation and large measurement and process errors. The best model results in FMSY = 0.87M (standard deviation (SD) = 0.05) for teleosts and FMSY = 0.41M (SD = 0.09) for chondrichthyans. Fproxy based on per-recruit analysis is about 15% smaller than FMSY. Results could be used to estimate FBRP from LHP in data-poor situations.},

abstract = {<p>Parameter estimation for the logistic (Schaefer) production model commonly uses an observation-error estimator, here termed the NM estimator, combining nonlinear-function minimization and forward projection of estimated population state. Although the NM estimator can be used to fit the generalized (Pella&#150;Tomlinson) production model, an equilibrium approximation method (EA) is often used, despite calls in the literature to abandon equilibrium estimators. We examined relative merits of NM and EA estimators for the generalized model by fitting 48 000 simulated data sets describing five basic stock trajectories and widely varying population characteristics. Simulated populations followed the generalized production model exactly but were observed with random error. Both estimators were used on each data set to estimate several quantities of management interest. The estimates from NM were usually more accurate and precise than EA estimates, and overall, NM outperformed EA. This is the most comprehensive study of the question to date&#151;the first to examine the generalized production model&#151;and it demonstrates clearly why equilibrium estimators should be abandoned. Although valuable when introduced, they are no longer computationally necessary, they are no less demanding of data, and their performance is poor.</p>},

abstract = {Fishery responses to climate change are occurring on time-scales relevant to the provision of short-term management advice. This is especially the case in climate change 'hotspots' such as south-eastern Australia, where the rate of ocean-warming is 3-4 times the global average. The application of harvest strategies utilizing biological reference points that do not take into account the effect of the changing environment on fish productivity may lead to unsustainable catch recommendations. Jackass morwong (Nemadactylus macropterus) is a moderately long-lived demersal species inhabiting continental shelf waters of the southern hemisphere. The most recent Stock Synthesis assessment for the species suggests that this stock has recently declined in abundance off south-eastern Australia. The stock assessment attributes the decline to mostly below average recruitment since 1985, but the recommended catch levels are based on an assumption of average recruitment from a stationary stock-recruitment relationship. The ability of Stock Synthesis to include an environmental variable to adjust the stock-recruitment relationship is used to model a regime shift on the average level of recruitment. Management strategy evaluation (MSE) is then used to examine the consequences of using the wrong recruitment assumption in the assessment used in the harvest strategy for setting the catches. The MSE shows that the consequences of mis-specifying the assessment model are greater if the assessment continues to assume that no shift in recruitment has occurred. Thus the more precautionary approach for management wishing to meet all the aims of the Australian government Harvest Strategy Policy is to assume that a shift in recruitment has occurred. A possible mechanism for how observed oceanic changes could be impacting jackass morwong recruitment is presented. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {Virgin recruitment (R0), the equilibrium recruitment in the absence of fishing, is an often used parameter in fisheries stock assessment for scaling population size. We describe and evaluate the use of the R0 likelihood component profile to diagnose selectivity misspecification, using simulation analysis for bigeye tuna in the eastern Pacific Ocean. The profile is evaluated under two types of selectivity misspecification: (1) misspecified shape and (2) misspecified temporal variation. The results indicate that length-composition data can provide substantial information on R0 estimation when the model is correctly specified, but can substantially bias estimates of absolute abundance when selectivity is misspecified. Although contradictory profiles for length-composition and abundance index data result from selectivity misspecification, they may not be useful in determining which survey or fishery selectivity is misspecified. The R0 profile selectivity diagnostic is based on the influence of composition data on absolute abundance. However, perhaps a more problematic and difficult to detect issue is the impact of length-composition data on biomass trends. The age-structured production model diagnostic could be applied to identify bias in both absolute biomass and biomass trend caused by age- or length-composition data in the presence of model misspecification. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

abstract = {In the last century, the growing evidence that global fisheries are depleting natural resources much faster than they can recover has led to negative processes, like overfishing, being addressed with increasingly complex models and thus mitigating or regulating actions that aim to protect stocks. Said negative processes contain two components: (i) they can diminish the reproductive potential of fish stocks, called over exploitation by recruitment, and (ii) the effect of early capture prevents the full realization of the growth potential, called overfishing by growth. In this article, the structure of common sardine sizes is analyzed. Due to the precise moment in which pre-recruits are incorporated into the exploited phase of the stock is unknown, the estimation of a recruitment size is a hard problem. This problem is addressed by modeling the mean size via a stochastic process, applying models of structural change. A time series (2001-2015) was analyzed on a weekly time scale based on the size structure of the pelagic fishery landings in the central-southern zone of Chile (32°10'-40°14' LS), from the V. to the XIV. Region. Specifically, the evolution of sizes according to macro-zones was studied for the conglomerates identified in two sub-zones, the V.-VIII. and IX.-XIV. Regions. In this context, the reference size for juveniles to cautiously allow the recruitment process of the common sardine from the central-southern zone of Chile was estimated, and the behavior of these sizes was spatially analyzed. Finally, a statistical inferential criterion was established that confirms the mean size of juveniles with a certain margin of error, which allows nonetheless later on to define a fraction that could be protected to avoid overfishing by growth.},

A gap in analysis methods has been the lack of classical likelihood methods for nonlinear state-space models. We evaluate a method that uses weighted kernel density estimates of Bayesian posterior samples to estimate likelihoods (Monte Carlo Kernel Likelihoods, MCKL). Classical likelihoods require integration over the state-space, and we compare MCKL to the widely used errors-in-variables (EV) method, which estimates states jointly with parameters by maximizing a nonintegrated likelihood. For a simulated, linear, autoregressive model and a Schaefer model fit to cape hake (Merluccius capensis × M. paradoxus) data, classical likelihoods outperform EV likelihoods, which give asymptotically biased parameter estimates and inaccurate confidence regions. Our results on the importance of integrated state-space likelihoods also support the value of Bayesian analysis with Monte Carlo posterior integration. Both approaches provide valuable insights and can be used complementarily. Previously, Bayesian analysis was the only option for incorporating process and observation errors with complex nonlinear models. The MCKL method provides a classical approach for such models, so that choice of analysis approach need not depend on model complexity.</p>},

abstract = {<p>Research shows that population status can be predicted using catch data, but there is little justification for why these predictions work or how they account for changes in fisheries management. We demonstrate that biomass can be reconstructed from catch data whenever fishing mortality follows predictable dynamics over time (called “effort dynamics”), and we develop a state-space catch only model (SSCOM) for this purpose. We use theoretical arguments and simulation modeling to demonstrate that SSCOM can, in some cases, estimate population status from catch data. Next, we use meta-analysis to estimate effort dynamics for US West Coast groundfishes before and after fisheries management changes in the mid-1990s. We apply the SSCOM using meta-analytic results to data for eight assessed species and compare results with stock assessment and data-poor methods. Results indicate general agreement among all three methods. We conclude that effort dynamics provides a theoretical basis for using catch data to reconstruct biomass and has potential for conducting data-poor assessments. However, we still recommend that index and compositional data be collected to allow application of data-rich methods.</p>},

Using data from 43 acoustic surveys conducted from 1983 through 2005 by the Peruvian Marine Institute (IMARPE), we examined the distribution of these two species relative to water masses. We tested the hypothesis that anchovy was found more frequently in upwelled cold coastal water (CCW) and mixed waters (MCW) than in other water types and that sardine was more associated with more offshore oceanic surface subtropical water (SSW). Surface temperature, salinity, latitude, season and distance to the coast data were used to define water masses. Results using generalized additive models (GAM), modelling sardine and anchovy presence-absence as a function of year, water body, bottom depth and latitude, showed that anchovy were primarily found in CCW and MCS, while sardine were more ubiquitous relative to water masses with some predilection for SSW. These results were supported by various indexes of anchovy and sardine distribution versus water mass as well as temporal and location variables. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The algorithm is applied to a simulated data set for Pacific cod (Gadus macrocephalus) and to catch data on Pseudotolithus typus and Decapterus russellii. The parameter estimates of Pacific cod obtained from this algorithm were comparable with the values that were originally used to simulate the data. Although the catch data of P. typus did not exhibit the full range of sizes present in the population due to differential vulnerability of the population to the fishery, the estimates of L <sub>∞</sub> and k reflect the growth over the entire size range of the population. Other population estimates for P. typus were in agreement with observed biological information. The estimated growth parameters L <sub>∞</sub> and k of D. russellii showed some discrepancy with the information available on mature individuals present in this fishery but appeared to adequately represent year 1 growth. The estimated population and exploitation parameters fit the observed catch-at-length. Estimates made with the catch-at-length approach can be improved by using auxiliary information that may be available on abundance, fishing effort, recruitment, and growth. </p>},

Processes modeled were transport, growth, and mortality of the early stages. The results showed that spatial and temporal variations in spawning modulated the survival of anchoveta eggs and yolk-sac larvae. The resultant transport of the early stages had an important south-north direction. In terms of connectivity, the greatest transfer of eggs and larvae to the pre-recruitment zone came from four spawning zones. Retention occurred in all spawning zones and was strongest in the Gulf of Arauco and at Lebu-Corral. Mortality due to temperature and advective losses was more intense at higher latitudes (Lebu-Corral). Observed and simulated distributions of eggs and larvae were compared, and the differences are discussed herein.

From March 1998, the Tasmanian government intends to base management of this fishery on output controls using individual transferable catch quotas. This has necessitated the development of a stock assessment model that can be used to evaluate the relative merits of a variety of alternative catch limits in terms of the trade-off between protecting the rock lobster resource and achieving a high yield. Each of eight regions around Tasmania is assessed separately because of spatial heterogeneity between regions in lobster growth, size at maturity and catch rates. The stock assessment model is size-structured and is fitted to catch, effort and length–frequency data as well as to estimates of exploitation rate from experimental data. A Bayesian estimation framework is employed to estimate the quantities needed for risk analysis. Egg production differs markedly among the eight regions: from as low as 6% of the unexploited equilibrium level in the northern regions, where the growth rate is fast, to more than 80% in the south-west, where the growth rate is slowest.</p>},

For many fisheries there is little chance of conducting formal stock assessments, and indicators of stock status have to be based on changes in measurable quantities such as catch rates and percentiles of the length distribution of the catch. Use of such empirical indicators for management decisions also requires a choice of appropriate reference or trigger levels for the indicators. Monte Carlo simulation can be used to examine the performance of alternative indicators and associated reference points in terms of their ability to correctly identify the biological conditions that they were designed to measure. This study examines the performance of several potential empirical indicators for broadbill swordfish off eastern Australia, taking into account uncertainties in stock structure, current status, and future trends in fishing effort. Indicators based on catch rates are shown to be potentially very misleading. In contrast, indicators based on the mean length or mean weight of the catch perform better, because these quantities change in a more predictable manner with abundance. Nevertheless, reference points based on these quantities are frequently ‘triggered' either too early or too late.</p>},

The simulations consider the impact of measurement error and process error in catchability and the length at 50% selectivity, as well as the implications of pooling data across populations that differ in terms of growth rate. The ability to estimate the virgin biomass depends critically on having catch-rate or size-composition data for earliest years of exploitation; in the absence of such data the estimates can be highly biased and imprecise. Several of the reference points commonly reported for assessment purposes (e.g. the biomass at which maximum sustainable yield is achieved) are, however, based on the estimate of the virgin biomass. Estimation performance (bias and precision of estimated quantities) deteriorates with increasing process error. For most of the scenarios examined, the expected benefits of increased precision arising from pooling data across spatial zones are not realized and better performance can be achieved by conducting assessments at the level of population and subsequently aggregating results spatially. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Within the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna there has not been agreement on a mechanism for adjusting quotas for the resource. It has been proposed that development of a decision-rule-based management strategy is an issue of high priority, indeed a matter of urgency. Results are presented from an initial application of a Monte Carlo management strategy evaluation (MSE) approach aimed at developing a rebuilding strategy for the stock. Southern bluefin tuna (Thunnus maccoyii) provides a substantial test of the power of this approach to develop a decision framework that can cope with large uncertainties about the current state of the stock and conflicting information from the fishery that is used in stock assessment. The results indicate that a robust feedback decision-making framework can be developed which ensures fast rates of recovery across the broad range of interpretations about stock dynamics and current status of the resource. Among the harvest strategies examined, the F0.2, F0.1, and SSB/R strategies were clearly the most robust and consistent in terms of recovery and sustainability. Fast recovery rates were only achieved with strategies that had catches substantially below 1998 levels. Within the strategies examined, little scope exists for improvement in yield without a direct loss in recovery performance. For the MSE approach to succeed, the operating, sampling, and conditioning model components must incorporate the full uncertainty about the real stock and the sampling processes appropriately. There is clearly scope for improving and broadening the way uncertainties have been handled in this initial examination. In particular, uncertainties associated with the catch-at-age, the relationship between the c.p.u.e, and true abundance, and the conditioning of the historical population sizes in the face of inconsistent historical data, need further development. As the MSE approach requires conditioning to historical data, full and appropriate incorporation of uncertainty into stock assessment and conditioning would lead to a better basis for developing and evaluating management procedures that will work.

abstract = {Surplus production modelling has a long history as a method for managing data-limited fish stocks. Recent advancements have cast surplus production models as state-space models that separate random variability of stock dynamics from error in observed indices of biomass. We present a stochastic surplus production model in continuous time (SPiCT), which in addition to stock dynamics also models the dynamics of the fisheries. This enables error in the catch process to be reflected in the uncertainty of estimated model parameters and management quantities. Benefits of the continuous-time state-space model formulation include the ability to provide estimates of exploitable biomass and fishing mortality at any point in time from data sampled at arbitrary and possibly irregular intervals. We show in a simulation that the ability to analyse subannual data can increase the effective sample size and improve estimation of reference points relative to discrete-time analysis of aggregated annual data. Finally, subannual data from five North Sea stocks are analysed with particular focus on using residual analysis to diagnose model insufficiencies and identify necessary model extensions such as robust estimation and incorporation of seasonality. We argue that including all known sources of uncertainty, propagation of that uncertainty to reference points and checking of model assumptions using residuals are critical prerequisites to rigorous fish stock management based on surplus production models.},

abstract = {An individual-based model (IBM) of anchoveta (Engraulis ringens) larvae was coupled to a climatological hydrodynamic (Regional Oceanic Modeling System, ROMS) model for central-southern Chile to answer the question as to whether or not across- and alongshore transport off central-southern Chile enhances retention in the spawning areas during the winter and summer reproductive periods, using model-based pre-recruitment indices (simulated transport success to nursery areas). The hydrodynamic model validation showed that ROMS captures the mean Seas Surface Temperature and Eddie Kinetic Energy observed in satellite-based data over the entire region. The IBM was used to simulate the transport of eggs and larvae from spawning zones in central Chile (Constituci{\'{o}}n, Dichato, Gulf of Arauco and Lebu-Corral) to historical nursery areas (HRZ, region between 35°S and 37°S). Model results corroborated HRZ as the most successful pre-recruitment zone (particles originated in the Dichato and Gulf of Arauco spawning areas), as well as identifying Lebu-Corral as a zone of high retention with a high associated pre-recruitment index (particles originated in the Lebu-Corral spawning zone). The highest pre-recruitment values were mainly found in winter. The Constituci{\'{o}}n and Dichato spawning zones displayed a typical summer upwelling velocity pattern, while the Gulf of Arauco in summertime showed strong offshore and alongshore velocity components. The Lebu-Corral region in winter presented important near-surface cross-shore transport towards the coast (associated with downwelling events), this might be one of the major mechanisms leading to high retention levels and a high pre-recruitment index for Lebu-Corral spawning zone. The limitations of the modeling approach are discussed and put into perspective for future work. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

At these latitudes, El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) forces climatic changes mainly through atmospheric teleconnections. Here we show that ENSO also modulates the timing, i.e. onset and end, of the upwelling season. In order to study the ENSO related wind-driven upwelling changes, compositing analysis was applied to coastal winds and to other atmospheric fields. During El Ni{\~{n}}o (La Ni{\~{n}}a) austral spring conditions, delayed (earlier-normal) onset of the upwelling season is associated with a meridional dipole characterized by weaken (stronger) South Pacific subtropical anticyclone and blocking (cyclonic) systems in theAmundsen- Bellingshausen Seas. During austral fall season, similar meridional dipole pattern described for spring La Ni{\~{n}}a conditions is related to delayed end of the upwelling season. Accordingly, shorter (longer) duration and weaker (stronger) intensity of upwelling season occurs during El Ni{\~{n}}o (La Ni{\~{n}}a) events off southern-central Chile. {\textcopyright} Copyright 2010 by the American Geophysical Union.},

ENSO-related interannual variability dominates the low-passed time series along the coast, with maximum amplitudes in the tropics decreasing southward. At tropical latitudes interdecadal variance is about one-third of the interannual variance while they are of similar amplitude in the midlatitudes (36°S). The correlation between the low frequency coastal modes and the Pacific and Atlantic SST suggests that the coastal SST variability comprises two main large-scale climate processes: the ENSO cycle at interannual timescale, and a basin-wide, perhaps even a global-scale, interdecadal oscillation.},

The eastern Scotian Shelf (ESS) cod fishery, which displays the retrospective problem, and simulated data are analysed to provide insight into the causes and potential solutions to this problem. The retrospective problem is shown to be a result of the traditional analysis techniques and a non-stationarity in the data used in the population analysis. A moving window analysis is developed which allows the non-stationarities to be identified and in some cases rectified. Recommendations are also made for ad hoc investigations of the data. The analysis suggests that failure to correct the retrospective problem for a stock with data like ESS cod could lead to catch-level advice that would be twice or more the intended level.},

Given a time series of annual catch and effort data, models in the Deriso– Schnute family predict exploitable biomass in the following year from biomass in the current and previous year and from past spawning stock. A state–space model is used, as it allows incorporation of random errors in both the biomass dynamics equations and the observations. Because the biomass dynamics are nonlinear, the common Kalman filter is generally not applicable for parameter estimation. However, it is demonstrated that the Bayesian approach can handle any form of nonlinear relationship in the state and observation equations as well as realistic distributional assumptions.

The flexibility of integrated analysis models allows them to be applied over extended time periods spanning historical decades with little information from which to estimate the annual signal of recruitment variability to modern periods in which more information about recruitment variability exists. Across this range of data availability, the estimation process must assure that the estimated log-normally distributed recruitments are mean unbiased to assure mean unbiased biomass estimates. Here we show how the estimation method implemented in the integrated analysis model, Stock Synthesis, achieves this unbiased characteristic in a penalized likelihood approach that is comparable to the results from Markov chain Monte Carlo. The total variability in recruitment is decomposed into variability among annual recruitment estimates based on information in the data and a residual variability. Because data are never perfectly informative, we show that estimated recruitment variability will always be less than the true variability among recruitments and that the method implemented here can be used to iteratively estimate the true variability among recruitments.</p>},

This pdf can help to provide advice to fishery managers about the consequences of alternative harvest policies and convey uncertainty about quantities of interest such as population biomass. In stock assessment, catch-age data are commonly used to estimate population parameters. However, there are few catch-age analyses that use Bayesian methods. In this paper, we extend the sampling-importance resampling algorithm so that a pdf of population model parameters can be estimated using catch-age data and indices of relative abundance. We illustrate the procedure by estimating a 54-parameter pdf for yellowfin sole (Limanda aspera) in the eastern Bering Sea. The example demonstrates how catch-age data can markedly improve Bayesian estimation, and also illustrates the potential for significant biases in treating trawl survey abundance indices as absolute measures of stock size.},

If not all of annual variation in CPUE is explained by the stock assessment model, the assessment may be statistically inadequate. The inadequacy may be in the representation of the population dynamics, in the relationship between CPUE and abundance, or due to additional variation in CPUE left unexplained by the independent variables. Catch-at-age data often have too much influence on the estimated abundance trajectory, so the sample size used in the catch-at-age likelihood function is often reduced when applying age-structured stock assessment methods. The integrated approach automatically places more weight on the CPUE data compared to the catch-at-age data, and may therefore provide an alternative to arbitrarily downweighting catch-at-age data. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The effects of differing within year coefficients of variation between individual abundance indices are investigated. Likelihoods which are specifically designed to be used with standardised abundance indices estimated from catch and effort data when CV's differ between years are presented. Monte Carlo simulation is used to investigate the proposed methods. Four main conclusions are drawn from the analysis: (1) Additional bias and reduced precision will be introduced into the population parameter estimates if the CV's differ between abundance indices and if this difference is not incorporated into the fitting procedure. These are potentially large enough to cause concern. (2) Two procedures are proposed which can incorporate differing yearly CV's. One method, the "Ad hoc" method appeared to perform the best. Both methods gave less biased estimates and lower average absolute error than the usual method of assuming a single CV for all index values. (3) The procedures proposed will give population parameter estimates which are better determined than if a single CV is assumed for all index values when there is a strong outlier index value with an associated high CV. (4) It is suggested that, when fitting population models to abundance indices generated by catch and effort data, both procedures (single and multiple CV's) be applied to test the sensitivity of the population parameter estimates to this potential source of bias. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

This study describes the reproductive activity of females of this species based on monthly variation of the Gonadosomatic Index (IGS) and the frequency of macroscopic states of maturity between January of 2006 and December of 2009 and microscopic states since February of 2007. The maturity at length of females was studied during the main spawning season. IGS monthly variation and the frequency of macroscopic states of maturity reached maximum values each year, between September and October, and minimum from January to June. In addition, the histological analysis of the ovaries confirmed that S. fueguensis is a partial spawner whose reproductive activity although tends to concentrate between September and October can be extended to December. The mean length at maturity of females during the reproductive season was 13.5 cm, indicating that they spawned at longer lengths in comparison with the same species from other localities. It is discussed that the increase of the reproductive activity in spring and larger maturity sizes could be part of a reproductive strategy of the species to enhance the survival during early stages in the inland seawater of Chilo{\'{e}}.},

The stations near the glacier showed low temperatures (1-3°C) and salinity (< 25), and high stability (Brunt-V{\"{a}}is{\"{a}}l{\"{a}} frequency N > 0.1 cycles s -1). Main ichthyoplankton taxa were eggs and larvae of southern sprat Sprattus fuegensis, lightfish Maurolicus parvipinnis, Macrouridae, and southern hake Merluccius australis. The main spawning area of S. fuegensis ($\sim$8000 eggs 10 m -2) occurred in mixed zones of the adjacent continental shelf, whereas the spawning of M. parvipinnis occurred in intermediate channels associated with medium stability values (N$\sim$0.06 cycles s -1). Fish egg and larval abundances were null or scarce near the glacier, and the abundance of M. parvipinnis eggs was positively related to the temperature and salinity of the water column, and negatively related to water column stability. Moreover, a negative relationship was observed between seawater density and the diameter of S. fuegensis eggs. The relation between ice melting and ichthyoplankton may have consequences for advective transport and mass mortality of fish eggs and larvae, as well as pelagic-benthic coupling in the Chilean South Patagonia. Global climate change has increased glacier ice melting at high latitudes, and the increased entry of colder, less saline waters in coastal areas may have consequences for the ichthyoplankton in the Chilean Patagonia.},

The package evaluates and maximizes the Laplace approximation of the marginal likelihood where the random effects are automatically integrated out. This approximation, and its derivatives, are obtained using automatic differentiation (up to order three) of the joint likelihood. The computations are designed to be fast for problems with many random effects (≈ 106) and parameters (≈ 103). Computation times using ADMB and TMB are compared on a suite of examples ranging from simple models to large spatial models where the random effects are a Gaussian random field. Speedups ranging from 1.5 to about 100 are obtained with increasing gains for large problems. The package and examples are available at http://tmb-project.org/.},

abstract = {A difficult question often confronting fisheries assessment scientists and managers is whether or not to accept that a shift in stock productivity has occurred. This is particularly the case when a stock has remained at historically low biomass despite management intervention and when there is an expectation that there should have been a stock recovery. We outline a weight-of-evidence approach that provides a structured means to evaluate this question. The approach, which scores a range of attributes, was applied to five fisheries from the NW Atlantic and SE Australia, chosen to provide a range of supporting evidence, as well as different potential causal mechanisms for a productivity shift. Given the resulting scores for the example stocks, and whether a productivity shift has been accepted for those stocks, a score of between 7 and 12 indicated a level required for acceptance of a productivity shift. The approach has highlighted areas of future research that would improve individual species scores. It is hoped that the paper will encourage a more systematic examination of potential stock productivity shifts in assessments than has hereto been the case.},

abstract = {Integrated analysis is widely used for fisheries stock assessment. The analysis has several merits, including its prevention of the loss of information and its enabling of the evaluation of uncertainties that arise when integrating individual data, such as size composition data and abundance indices. However, the data integration itself causes one of the most difficult problems: conflicts among data sources. This paper provides an illustrative explanation of how data conflict can occur under model mis-specification on selectivity in a multi-fishery integrated stock assessment model through simulation with known parameters. We demonstrated that estimation bias can be caused under various scenarios of model mis-specifications on selectivity. Relative likelihood profiles decomposed into the likelihood components from different data sources revealed data conflicts among multiple datasets under the model mis-specifications, whereas the relative likelihood profiles displayed no severe data conflicts without any model mis-specifications. Data conflicts occurred because a single estimation model without correct selectivity assumptions cannot explain the observed multiple data sources simultaneously. We also found that almost all of the parameters estimated in the integrated model were potentially affected by the model mis-specification in any single component of selectivity for a specific fishery. If we accumulate empirical knowledge on the general patterns of conflicts and what types of data sources are robust against typical model mis-specifications, the relative likelihood profiles could be utilized more efficiently in diagnostics to identify potential model mis-specifications and to obtain more accurate estimates of the quantities of interest for stock management. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Occupancy models are employed in species distribution modelling to account for imperfect detection during field surveys. While this approach is popular in the literature, problems can occur when estimating the model parameters. In particular, the maximum likelihood estimates can exhibit bias and large variance for data sets with small sample sizes, which can result in estimated occupancy probabilities near 0 and 1 ('boundary estimates'). In this paper, we explore strategies for estimating parameters based on maximizing a penalized likelihood. Penalized likelihood methods augment the usual likelihood with a penalty function that encodes information about what parameter values are undesirable. We introduce penalties for occupancy models that have analogues in ridge regression and Bayesian approaches, and we compare them to a penalty developed for occupancy models in prior work. We examine the bias, variance and mean squared error of parameter estimates obtained from each method on synthetic data. Across all of the synthetic data sets, the penalized estimation methods had lower mean squared error than the maximum likelihood estimates. We also provide an example of the application of these methods to point counts of avian species. Penalized likelihood methods show similar improvements when tested using empirical bird point count data. We discuss considerations for choosing among these methods when modelling occupancy. We conclude that penalized methods may be of practical utility for fitting occupancy models with small sample sizes, and we are releasing R code that implements these methods.},

abstract = {Despite high primary productivity, the yield of pelagic fish in the southern Benguela is relatively low compared to that in the Humboldt system. Part of the constraint may be the ability of pelagic fish to reproduce successfully in a strongly pulsed upwelling environment, where enrichment, retention and concentration mechanisms are less compatible than in Peru-Chile. Anchovy Engraulis capensis spawn upstream of the main upwelling centres on the food-poor, thermally stratified western Agulhas Bank, over a protracted summer season (October-February) when high wind speeds of 7-8 m.s-1 are prevalent. Eggs spawned farther east, on the central or eastern Agulhas Bank, may be subject to increased cannibalism and advective losses, whereas those spawned farther west could be susceptible to heavy advective losses offshore during periods of strong southerly winds. Copepod concentrations are negatively correlated with spawner biomass on the western Bank and are inversely linked to high rates of gonad atresia in anchovy and reduced subsequent recruitment. There is a restricted area of suitable spawning temperatures (16-19°C) on the western Bank, and fish outside that range appear to have less successful spawning, affecting recruitment; a reduction of the duration of spawning appears to decrease the chances of good recruitment. Oil content of pelagic catches on the west coast of South Africa suggests that good feeding conditions for adult fish are also favourable for growth of young fish in the nursery area. An inverse correlation between the numbers of recruits estimated in June and the strength of upwelling-favourable winds over the previous summer indicates the importance of advective loss of eggs and larvae in the transport and nursery areas. The presence of Agulhas Rings close to the shelfedge, predators on juvenile anchovy, and the strength of upwelling on the West Coast could also be important factors affecting recruitment success. There seem to have been changes in the inshore-offshore distributions of spawning anchovy and/or their eggs over the past three decades, resulting in different recruitment responses to south-easterly winds.},

abstract = {Data on the length structure of exploited stocks are one of the easiest sources of information to obtain for data-poor fisheries, and have the potential to provide cost-effective solutions to the management of data-poor fisheries. However, incorporating the results from stock assessments into a formal harvest strategy, defined here as a harvest management system that incorporates monitoring, assessment, and decisions rules for a specific fishery, usually requires information on the total catch or catch-per-unit effort, data that are not available for many data-poor fisheries. This paper describes and tests a harvest strategy where only length composition data of the catch and knowledge of basic biological parameters are available. The harvest strategy uses a recently developed methodology for stock assessment that estimates the spawning potential ratio (SPR) for an exploited stock from the length structure of the catch (the length-based SPR model; LB-SPR), and uses an effort-based harvest control rule to iteratively drive fishing pressure towards a target level of SPR (40%). A management strategy evaluation framework was used to explore the behaviour of various parameterizations of the harvest control rule for three species with a diverse range of life-histories and M/k ratios ranging from 0.36 (unfished population dominated by large fish) to the Beverton-Holt invariant M/k of 1.5 (unfished population dominated by smaller fish). For all three species the harvest strategy was able to guide the fisheries towards the target SPR, although the time taken for the SPR to stabilise at the target SPR was greatest for the species with the greatest longevity and the lowest M/k. The results of this proof-of-concept study demonstrate that the combination of the LB-SPR assessment model with an iterative, effort-based harvest control rule can successfully rebuild an overfished stock back to sustainable levels or fish down a stock to the target SPR without significantly overshooting the target.},

Can fisheries-induced evolution shift reference points for fisheries management? – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 70: 707–721. Biological reference points are important tools for fisheries management. Reference points are not static, but may change when a population's environment or the population itself changes. Fisheries-induced evolution is one mechanism that can alter population characteristics, leading to “shifting” reference points by modifying the underlying biological processes or by changing the perception of a fishery system. The former causes changes in “true” reference points, whereas the latter is caused by changes in the yardsticks used to quantify a system's status. Unaccounted shifts of either kind imply that reference points gradually lose their intended meaning. This can lead to increased precaution, which is safe, but potentially costly. Shifts can also occur in more perilous directions, such that actual risks are greater than anticipated. Our qualitative analysis suggests that all commonly used reference points are susceptible to shifting through fisheries-induced evolution, including the limit and “precautionary” reference points for spawning-stock biomass, Blim and Bpa, and the target reference point for fishing mortality, F0.1. Our findings call for increased awareness of fisheries-induced changes and highlight the value of always basing reference points on adequately updated information, to capture all changes in the biological processes that drive fish population dynamics.</p>},

abstract = {Fishery management plans for U.S. fisheries are required to specify status determination criteria (e.g. whether the stock is overfished and whether overfishing is occurring) and typically use harvest control rules to adjust target and limit fishing mortality and catch levels to prevent overfishing, achieve optimum yield and rebuild overfished stocks. The status determination criteria are based on the concept of the fishing mortality rate (FMSY) that maximizes long-term catch as the upper limit on the allowable rate of fishing and the associated BMSY, the spawning biomass which produces MSY, is the target for rebuilding of overfished stocks. In practice, proxies for the biological reference points FMSY and BMSY are often employed. Although several methods exist for estimating these quantities, it is unclear which performs best. Simulation is therefore used to evaluate alternative estimators for these quantities. These estimators differ in terms of whether a stock-recruitment relationship is estimated, and whether a prior based on Bayesian meta-analysis is used as a penalty on steepness, a critical parameter of the stock-recruitment relationship. The simulations consider three life histories: a long-lived unproductive rockfish, a moderately long-lived and productive flatfish, and a hake, which is also moderately long-lived and productive, but exhibits highly variable recruitment. Results indicate that estimator performance varies among reference points. However, estimators of B0, the average spawning biomass in the absence of exploitation, and stock depletion based on a fitted stock-recruitment relationship generally perform best. B0 is estimated either better (the rockfish and flatfish) or similarly (the hake) to stock depletion. Estimating BMSY from the fit of the stock-recruitment relationship performed best for the rockfish and flatfish life histories; average recruitment estimators proved to be best for the flatfish and hake life histories. Proxy methods of calculating BMSY generally performed relatively poor in comparison to the non-proxy measures. The performance of estimators of biological reference points was generally better for the rockfish and flatfish life histories, which were similar, than for the hake life history. Estimator performance was generally poorer in the presence of high recruitment variability. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {There is strong evidence that low frequency between-year environmental variability, in addition to fishing, is able to affect fish population abundance via recruitment. However, scientific advice regarding catch limits is often based on control rules that depend on the estimation of biomass reference points which typically do not explicitly consider the effects of trends over time in reference points caused by environmental variability. Harvest rates based on commonly used biological reference points such as the level of unfished spawning biomass (B0), the current size of the stock in relation to B0, and BMSY that are sustainable under current environmental conditions may be unsustainable under different environmental conditions. Although several methods exist for estimating biomass reference points, it is unclear which of these are most robust to the effects of long term, low frequency environmental variability. Therefore, simulation is used to evaluate alternative estimators, which differ in terms of how the stock-recruitment relationship is modeled, and whether explicit estimators or proxies are used for B0, the steepness of the stock-recruitment relationship, and current spawning biomass relative to B0. The simulations consider three life histories: a long-lived unproductive rockfish, a moderately long-lived and productive flatfish, and a moderately long-lived and productive hake with highly variable recruitment. Results indicate that in the presence of low frequency autocorrelated forcing of recruitment, biomass reference points should be based on average recruitment and/or dynamic B0 if catch and survey data are available for at least one full period of the environmental variable. In contrast, previous analysis suggests that in the absence of autocorrelated environmental forcing of recruitment, and if the available catch and survey data do not span at least, in this case, 50 years which is one full period of the environmental variable, biomass reference points should be based on the fit of the stock-recruitment relationship. Life history affects the estimability of biomass reference points, which are more difficult to estimate for species with more rapid dynamics such as hake. The method used to calculate the reference points given the results of a stock assessment has a larger effect on estimability than the configuration of the stock assessment method, for the three stock assessment model configurations investigated in this study.},

abstract = {Off southern-central Chile, the impact of spring upwelling variability on common sardine (Strangomera bentincki) recruitment was examined by analyzing satellite and coastal station winds, satellite chlorophyll, and common sardine recruitment from a stock assessment model. In austral spring, the intensity of wind-driven upwelling is related to sea surface temperature (SST) from the Ni{\~{n}}o 3.4 region, being weak during warm periods (El Ni{\~{n}}o) and strong during cold periods (La Ni{\~{n}}a). Interannual changes in both spring upwelling intensity and SST from the Ni{\~{n}}o 3.4 region are related to changes in remotely sensed chlorophyll over the continental shelf. In turn, year-to-year changes in coastal chlorophyll are tightly coupled to common sardine recruitment. We propose that, in the period 1991-2004, interannual changes in the intensity of spring upwelling affected the abundance and availability of planktonic food for common sardine, and consequently determined pre-recruit survival and recruitment strength. However, the importance of density-dependent factors on the reproductive dynamic cannot be neglected, as a negative association exists between spawning biomass and recruitment-per-spawning biomass. Coastal chlorophyll, upwelling intensity, and SST anomalies from the Ni{\~{n}}o 3.4 region could potentially help to predict common sardine recruitment scenarios under strong spring upwelling and El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-related anomalies. {\textcopyright} 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd..},

abstract = {Though it is by far the most commonly used likelihood for composition data (proportions at length or age) in fisheries stock assessment models, the multinomial is poorly suited for this task. It has two salient weaknesses: it can not replicate the correlations found in these data; and it is not self-weighting (i.e., the parameters that weight the composition data can not be estimated inside the model). This latter weakness derives from the fact that the multinomial likelihood, being designed for discrete data but used for continuous data, is improper (i.e., its integral over all permissible data values is not constant). All other likelihoods commonly used for composition data share at least one of these weaknesses but there is one - the logistic-normal - which can be extended to avoid both. Some, like the multivariate normal, are misused because their structure ignores the defining properties of composition data: that they lie between 0 and 1, and sum to 1. A collection of 72 composition data sets from 28 stock assessments originating from nine different computer programs was used to evaluate the extended logistic-normal, together with the Dirichlet likelihood, which is self-weighting but does not allow positive correlations (and so may be useful for composition data with small correlations). The logistic-normal appears very promising, especially for unsexed length compositions. The next step in evaluating the extended logistic-normal likelihood will be to code it into stock assessment programs, and some of the technical problems associated with this step are discussed. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

We investigated the inter-cohort variability in length-at-age and somatic growth of the common sardine on the south-central coast of Chile. Using length frequency decomposition analysis of monthly samples from 1990 to 2006, we obtained the mean length-at-age and estimated 15 cohort specific asymptotic growth models (von Bertalanffy) with additional seasonal parameters. Results showed a conspicuous inter-cohort variability in the mean length and growth rate at different life stages throughout the first year of life. Striking anomalies (positive and negative) were observed during the 97/98 ENSO (El Ni{\~{n}}o South Oscillation), but the mechanisms behind these dynamics are unknown. Nevertheless, we investigated the impact of these variables on the optimal cohort yield. Simulations show that optimal age (month) to begin exploitation varies between cohorts, and a large portion of available cohort is lost by applying fishing mortality in a sub-optimal period. Therefore, monitoring size composition of each incoming cohort and use of an appropriate harvest strategy could help to better manage this resource and optimize fishery benefits. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The degree of match and mismatch in the time of larval production and production of their food has been put forward as an explanation of part of the variability in recruitment to a stock of fish. The magnitude of recruitment is not completely determined until the year-class finally joins the adult stock, and the processes involved probably begin early in the life-history of the fish when both their growth and mortality rates are high. The match/mismatch hypothesis is given in this chapter to cover the subsequent development through larval life up to metamorphosis, and possibly just beyond. The match/mismatch hypothesis has now been extended to the upwelling areas and oceanic divergences equatorward of 40° latitude on the basis that fish in these regions release batches of eggs more frequently when they are well fed and, more generally, that pelagic fish may modify their reproductive strategies such that they can feed and spawn at the same time. A delay in predation is of great importance, particularly when production peaks in early development. This model illustrates the difficulties that occur when growth and mortality are allowed to interact. On the other hand, there are three consequences of the match/mismatch hypothesis that are presented in this chapter. However, the limited conclusion drawn in this chapter is that, investigations of fish larvae should continue to be a part of the study of population dynamics of fishes. {\textcopyright} 1990, Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Size and shape of fish otoliths are species-specific, but some species also display intraspecific variations. The common sardine, Strangomera bentincki, is a small pelagic fish inhabiting a seasonal upwelling ecosystem off centralsouthern Chile, having two discrete spawning sites along its latitudinal distribution. Otoliths of specimens were collected from commercial catches in Talcahuano and Corral, representing the central and south spawning zones. On the basis of otolith images, size-based shape descriptors were used to detect ontogenetic variation, and morphometric variables (length, breadth, area, perimeter and weight) were used to detect geographical differences in size and shape of otoliths. Outline analysis was studied on the basis of elliptic Fourier descriptors through multivariate statistical procedures. Size-based shape descriptors showed that otolith shape starts to be stable for fish larger than 12 cm total length, which keep an elliptical form. Morphometric variables for fish larger than 12 cm revealed intraspecific variation between central and south zones, which were associated with otolith weight and breadth. Outline analysis did not reveal significant spatial differences, but extreme intraspecific variation was due to the antirostrum, excisure, and posterior part of otoliths. Intraspecific variation in otolith size could be linked to differences in each spawning habitat and related to geographical origin, whose differences are not clearly identified. It is concluded that intraspecific variability in morphometric variables of sardine otoliths revealed geographic differences in size that are not attributable to allometric effects, and that otolith shape was similar between specimens from different geographic origin.},

abstract = {In this paper, the first daily egg production method (DEPM) parameters were estimated for anchovy and common sardine stocks distributed in the central-south area off Chile (33-40°S). The study area was stratified according to the topography, shape and orientation of the coastal line, and the survey was carried out on the continental shelf during the main spawning peak (August-September, 2002). The bulk of the spawning of both species was successfully covered, which was characterized by a coastal distribution within the first 20 nautical miles, and following the inner zone associated with the 100 m bottom depth. The coastal distribution of the spawning can be related to the oceanographic conditions occurring during the transition from winter to spring (southern Hemisphere), which are characterized by the alternation between northerly and southerly winds. Probably, these factors are interacting to produce enrichment, concentration and retention of egg in coastal zones in the study area. The daily egg production rate (P0) was estimated for two geographic strata, and was different in each region. Also, the length frequency and adult reproductive parameters were different between geographic strata, specially the daily spawning fraction. For anchovy, the P0 was lower in comparison with available estimates for the same species in Peru and in the north area off Chile. Also, the relative fecundity of anchovy was lower, probably because anchovy in the study area have bigger eggs as compared with the anchovy in Northern Chile. The DEPM parameters estimated for common sardine in the investigated area were similar to the range of existing values for the Engraulis genus in other upwelling areas. The stratified spawning stock biomass estimate was 133,031 t (CV = 44%) for anchovy and 706,792 t (CV = 68%) for common sardine. Probably, daily egg production and adult reproductive parameters of both species are highly variables and further research is suggested for improvements future DEPM application for the species. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Intense fishing mortality generates changes in marine populations and ecosystems, and an increase in the sensitivity to environmental changes. Fishery-induced demographic changes are the main mechanisms involved due to truncation of age structure of a population trough selective removal of larger and older fish from a population. As a consequence, changes in the seasonal spawning pattern can occur because larger and older fish tend to have a longer and more extensive reproductive activity than smaller and first-time spawners. This is the case of a small pelagic fish, known as the common sardine Strangomera bentincki, which supports an important fish activity off central southern Chile (33°S-41°30' S). In this paper, fishery-induced changes on the seasonal reproductive cycle of common sardine were simulated through an age-structured population dynamics on a monthly basis. The fishery is dependent on the annual pulse of recruitment and fishing efforts are applied intensively on the juvenile fraction during the first half of each year. Thus, fishing mortality removes fast growing fish or fish recruiting earlier, and thereafter the age structure tends to be truncated, and as a consequence, slow-growing fish or late-recruiting fish could be selected in the population. A delayed peak in the reproductive cycle was observed in the gonadosomatic index during the period 2000-2010, as compared with the period 1993-1999. In addition, a change in the length composition of the catches was observed, supporting the results obtained with simulations. The fishery-induced changes on the reproductive cycle of common sardine can increase the sensitivity of the population to climate variability either matching or mismatching the reproductive cycle with favorable/unfavorable environmental variables for recruitment. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Monthly length-frequency data, from July 1990 to November 1999, were used to identify cohorts, to analyze growth, and to determine the monthly age composition of the catches. The abundance of cohorts was estimated using cohort analysis on a monthly time-scale that is sufficiently small for capturing the rapid seasonal changes that characterize both resources. An ADAPT approach was used to estimate the unknown parameters by using catch per unit effort (CPUE) data as auxiliary information. Growth was a regular process for different cohorts of both species, and a seasonal oscillating growth curve was fitted. The parameters of the seasonal von Bertalanffy growth function were: L∞ = 17.7cm, K=0.79yr-1, to =-0.347 yr, C=0.996, and winter point (WP) = 0.373 (r2 = 0.930, n = 207, P < 0.05) for common sardine; L∞ = 20.8cm, K = 0.444yr-1, to = -0.392 yr, C = 0.849, and WP = 0.310 (r2 = 0.906, n = 203, P < 0.05) for anchovy. The growth rates were slowest between April and May, before the spawning season. Recruitment of common sardine occurred in November, while recruitment of anchovy tended to occur in January. The yearly pulse of recruitment dominates the population dynamics of both species, and it was observed that the recruitment of the two species varies inversely. The 1997 cohort of common sardine was the lowest in the 1990s, but recruitment of anchovy was higher, probably as a consequence of the 1997-1998 El Ni{\~{n}}o event. The biomass of the common sardine stock declined from 1997 to 1999, while fishing effort was growing. On the contrary, the biomass of anchovy was higher in 1998 and 1999 due to the stronger cohorts of 1996 and 1997. Evidence for density-dependent catchability was found for sardine, but not for anchovy.

abstract = {The reproductive period of Strangomera bentincki and Engraulis ringens and the size at first maturity (Lm50%) are analyzed for the period 1993-1997. The reproductive indicators used are the gonadosomatic index (GSI) and the temporal frequency of macroscopic sexual maturity stages for mature and hydrated females. Lm50% was determined on the basis of 50% of mature females criteria using a logistic equation fitted to observed data. The month at maximum GSI, between July and September, has the lowest interannual variability, i.e. coefficients of variation of 5.1% y 14.6% for S. bentincki and E. ringens respectively. The month at secondary maximum GSI presented coefficients of variation of 45% for S. bentincki and of 35.3% for E. ringens. Lm50% was estimated in 10 cm TL for S. bentincki and 11.5 cm for E. ringens. The Lm50% of S. bentincki is achieved in July, at the end of the first year of life, while the Lm50% of E. ringens is achieved in February, at about 1.5 year old. It is postulated that the populational reproductive period for both species, occurring in August during winter time, is a consequence of the adaptation to the seasonal coastal upwelling ecosystem off central-southern Chile. A higher productivity (e.g.food) in the coastal waters can be found as a consequence of the occurrence of upwelling events from middle September to late March. Under this hypothesis, larval stages and juveniles could find good conditions for growth and survival during spring and summer time, and adults could gain energy that could be used in gonad maturation for the reproduction during winter time, the less-productive season.},

abstract = {The method of maximum likelihood is widely used in epidemiology, yet many epidemiologists receive little or no education in the conceptual underpinnings of the approach. Here we provide a primer on maximum likelihood and some important extensions which have proven useful in epidemiologic research, and which reveal connections between maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods. For a given data set and probability model, maximum likelihood finds values of the model parameters that give the observed data the highest probability. As with all inferential statistical methods, maximum likelihood is based on an assumed model and cannot account for bias sources that are not controlled by the model or the study design. Maximum likelihood is nonetheless popular, because it is computationally straightforward and intuitive and because maximum likelihood estimators have desirable large-sample properties in the (largely fictitious) case in which the model has been correctly specified. Here, we work through an example to illustrate the mechanics of maximum likelihood estimation and indicate how improvements can be made easily with commercial software. We then describe recent extensions and generalizations which are better suited to observational health research and which should arguably replace standard maximum likelihood as the default method. {\textcopyright} The Author 2013.

abstract = {In Chile, anchovy (Engraulis ringens) and common sardine (Strangomera bentincki) are two commercially important small pelagic fish. In southern Chile (32-41° S), both species coexist and inhabit the coastal zone. In northern Chile (18-25°. S), only anchovy is present in the coastal zone. The determine onset, peak, end, and duration of the spawning periods in these small pelagic fish are key factors in population studies and of great interest for fisheries management. The objective of this study is to determine the temporal trends of spawning in these two species. A quantitative method was developed to obtain objective indicators of the spawning periods and the method is a useful tool for comparative studies between populations as well as to study the relationship of spawning periods with other demographic variables affected by fishing or environmental variability. Peak spawning in the three populations was consistent through time but showed changes in the duration of the maximum reproductive period. Anchovy and common sardine of the southern zone show synchrony and a shortening of the duration of spawning periods, probably in response to environmental fluctuations. Anchovy in northern Chile have shown an increase in duration from 1986 that is coincidental with the regime shift reported for the Humboldt Current Ecosystem in the mid-1980s. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Growth parameters (L∞, K, and t0) and natural mortality of the Patagonian sprat (Sprattus fuegensis) Chilo{\'{e}} inland sea were estimated. This area corresponds to the northern limit of the species distribution in the South Pacific Ocean. A total of 1,584 otolith were analyzed between July 2005 and December 2006. A covariance analysis ruled out significant differences (P = 0.654) in the otolith size-fish length relationship between males and females. The otoliths showed high monthly proportion of hyaline edge type in August 2005 and from July to October 2006. The hyaline band formation from mid-winter to spring coincided with the breeding season extending from September to December. This suggests an annual periodicity of annuli formation, likely as a consequence of channeling energy into reproduction. The growth parameters were L∞= 17.71 cm; K = 0.78 yr-1; and t0 = -0.46 yr, while the maximum observed age was 6 years. Natural mortality given growth parameters and species maturity, was estimated at 1.0 yr-1. The modal decomposition of monthly length distribution, analyzed by a statistical-numerical algorithm (MIX approach) gave similar results to those obtained from otolith readings.},

abstract = {The Engraulis ringens distribution (4 to 42° S) covers a wide variety of environmental conditions. We assessed the coping mechanisms used by this anchoveta in different spawning habitats, reporting differences in egg traits between populations off northern (Iquique, 20° S) and southern Chile (Talcahuano, 36° S) and throughout the spawning season. Eggs were smaller off Iquique, declined in size during the reproductive season (both populations), and inter-population differences persisted throughout the spawning season. Batch fecundity (eggs per batch per female) and relative fecundity (eggs per female weight) were lower off Talcahuano during the peak spawning months. Thus, larger eggs spawned in the southern population seem to be produced at the cost of a reduction in fecundity. The eggs also differed biochemically between the 2 populations; total lipids and triacyl-glycerides were much higher off Talcahuano. The biochemical composition (both populations) also changed throughout the spawning season, with higher lipids early in the spawning season (July to August) off Talcahuano. Hatching success decreased during the spawning season, and correlated positively with egg size and lipid contents. Environmental conditions differed markedly between spawning areas and from mid-winter to late spring. Off Talcahuano, the temperature and winter-time water column productivity are lower and turbulence is higher, while eggs are larger, lipid contents higher, and batch fecundity lower. This mechanism seems to facilitate survival of young offspring in the more adverse winter conditions off Talcahuano. These egg characteristics are determined by the adult female reproductive system, representing a maternal influence on the early life-history traits of anchoveta that might enable rapid changes in population densities in some years of improved habitat conditions. {\textcopyright} 2009 Inter-Research.},

abstract = {We assessed the fatty acid (FA) composition of anchoveta eggs collected from the plankton along with female anchoveta reproductive traits and environmental conditions during peak winter spawning in 2005 and 2007. Environmental conditions differed markedly between years at 3 continental shelf stations off Talcahuano, Chile, with a warmer, fresher water column in 2005 and a colder, saltier one in 2007. We confirmed differences in sea surface temperature, measured both at the coastal egg collection stations and using satellite images over a broader area, caused by south winds that induced coastal upwelling in 2007. Winter 2005 was largely dominated by typical small omnivorous and carnivorous copepods (Oncaea and Oithona), whereas in 2007, larger herbivorous calanoid copepods (with high polyunsaturated FA [PUFA] levels that are typical of upwelling conditions) and diatom abundance (indicated by the docosahexaenoic/eicosapentaenoic acids [DHA/EPA] ratio) increased. Although anchoveta eggs were smaller in 2005, batch size and relative fecundity per female were greater in 2007 because of larger ovaries. While relative amounts of saturated (SAFA), monounsaturated (MUFA) FA, and PUFA in anchoveta eggs in 2005 were within the ranges reported for marine fish species, in 2007, PUFA were in the upper and SAFA and MUFA in the lower ranges. Our results suggest that the higher PUFA and lower DHA/EPA values for anchoveta eggs in 2007 may have resulted from increased consumption of larger herbivorous copepods or direct consumption of larger phytoplankton, prey typical of cold upwelling conditions. Conversely, elevated SAFA and MUFA levels in 2005 may have resulted from consumption of smaller omnivorous/carnivorous copepods by adult fish. {\textcopyright} Inter-Research 2010.},

abstract = {The inter-cohort variability in the von Bertalanffy (VB) growth parameters of common sardine (Strangomera bentincki) was analyzed for the period between 1990 and 2007. Time series of monthly length-frequency data were used to study the growth of the species. The MIX software was used to separate normal components and modal progression analysis was used to identify cohorts that have recruited each year. The VB growth parameters were estimated using nonlinear mixed-effects model (NLME) by considering that the population growth parameters have a common distribution, and that cohort-specific parameters can be treated as random effects. A model that considered L∞ (asymptotic length) and K (growth coefficient) as random effects was the best in explaining inter-cohort changes in body growth. The growth rate during the first fast-growing period of sardine cohorts exhibited a significant change after 1998. Cohorts recruited between 1990 and 1997 showed higher growth rates than cohorts recruited from 1999 to 2006. This significant change is coincident with a colder period established in the area after 1998, and with a significant increment in the Ekman transport. Sea surface temperature anomalies explained 46.2% of the variability observed in the early growth rate of the cohorts. It is concluded that environmental conditions encountered by the cohorts during the spawning period could modulate the growth rate of common sardine year to year, but the possibility of further intrinsic factors affecting the growth dynamics of common sardine could be also important and deserve to be considered in future studies. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Stock status for many medium- and small-scale fisheries is unknown due, for example, to a lack of catch data and the absence of scientific observer programs. However, length-frequency data are often available for such fisheries because they are the cheapest and easiest data to obtain. Various stock assessment methods have been developed that use length-frequency data and make equilibrium assumptions regarding both recruitment and fishing mortality. These assumptions raise questions regarding the reliability of the results, particularly when the method is applied to a single sample of length-frequency. We developed a Length-Based Pseudo-cohort Analysis (LBPA) model whose parameters can be estimated using multiple length frequencies and penalized maximum likelihood, under the assumption that using more than one length-frequency sample reduces the effects of the equilibrium conditions assumed in the model. We explored the performance of LBPA using simulations that examined the implications for estimation of the spawning potential rate (SPR) and the relative fishing mortality (F/FMSY). These simulations considered scenarios related to exploitation rate, steepness, numbers of years and sample sizes for length-frequency, and data weights. The performance of LBPA was compared to that of length-based spawning potential ratio (LBSPR). LBPA performed better with additional length-frequencies than with increased sample size, irrespective of how the data were weighted, and generally outperformed LBSPR. Estimates were more accurate and less biased when exploitation rates were high. This work provides guidelines that should be considered when using length-based pseudo-cohort models for data-poor fisheries.},

abstract = {<p>The retrospective problem involves systematic differences in sequential population analysis (SPA) estimates of stock size or some other quantity in a reference year. The differences occur as successively more data are used for estimation, and they appear to be structural biases caused by a mis-specification of the SPA. In some cases the retrospective problem is so severe that the SPA is considered to be too unreliable for stock assessment purposes. There are many possible sources of retrospective patterns, and it is usually difficult in practice to determine which are more likely. We propose diagnostics to help determine the more likely causes. We use local influence diagnostics to investigate whether small changes or perturbations to SPA input components such as catches or natural mortalities can remove or reduce retrospective patterns. We show, for the fall-spawning herring stock in the southern Gulf of St. Lawrence SPA, that relatively small age- and year-specific changes to the SPA assumptions about the proportional relationship between an abundance index and stock size can result in greatly reduced retrospective patterns. We therefore conclude primafacie that these assumptions are a plausible source of the retrospective pattern. Larger changes to catches, natural mortality assumptions, or estimation weights are required to reduce the retrospective pattern. These other factors seem to be less plausible sources of the retrospective pattern, although this is best assessed by the herring stock experts who are more knowledgeable about the fishery and other scientific information for this stock.</p>},

Analytical reference points for age-structured models: application to data-poor fisheries. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 67: 165–175. Analytical solutions for biological reference points are derived in terms of maximum lifetime reproductive rate. This rate can be calculated directly from biological parameters of maturity, fecundity, and natural mortality or a distribution for this rate can be derived from appropriate metadata. Minimal data needs and assumptions for determining stock status are discussed. The derivations lead to a re-parameterization of the common stock–recruit relationships, Beverton–Holt and Ricker, in terms of spawning potential ratio. Often, parameters in stock–recruit relationships are restricted by tight prior distributions or are fixed based on a hypothesized level of stock resilience. Fixing those parameters is equivalent to specifying the biological reference points. An ability to directly calculate reference points from biological data, or a meta-analysis, without need of a full assessment model or fisheries data, makes the method an attractive option for data-poor fisheries. The derivations reveal an explicit link between the biological characteristics of a species and appropriate management. Predicted stock status for a suite of shark species was compared with recent stock assessment results, and the method successfully identified whether each stock was overfished.</p>},

Implications for stock recruit function parameterizations are also noted. For the range of variability explored in this illustration, skipped spawning had a negligible impact on reference points, while factors related to spawner condition or experience and density independent survival of recruits (i.e. slope at the origin) had greater effects. When estimating yield per recruit (YPR) associated with a specified SPR, the variability in the biological parameters was greatly dampened. Estimating correlations between the observed trends in maturity and fecundity, and developing models to forecast the probabilities associated with observing a biological state in the future, would be an important contribution to understanding uncertainty in rebuilding projections and future catch advice. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

In Chile, MSE has not been applied to manage these fisheries and scientific advice has been developed on the evaluation of harvest strategies using single species stock assessment models. For both resources the following topics were analyzed: i) alternation of population abundance pulses associated with recruitment and catches, ii) temporal variability in recruitment strength, iii) seasonality of cohort and species-specific growth, and iv) relationship resource-environment. Results show that the topics analyzed in this work should be considered in the development of an operating model and/or harvest control rules, given the mixed nature of both fisheries, the marked alternation and the influence of environmental conditions. Therefore, it is proposed that the design and implementation of a MSE for sardine and anchovy complex, considers the elements outlined in this study and within the framework of multi-specific assessment and mixed fishery management.},

abstract = {Two indirect stock assessment models are implemented in order to analyze changes in the common sardine abundance. One model uses a calendar-year configuration (January-December year t) and the other a biological-year configuration (July year t - June year t+1). Each model is contrasted with catch-at-length data, total catch in weight, catch per unit effort from 1990 to 2002, and biomass from acoustic surveys done every January from 2000 to 2002 off central-southern Chile. The two applied population dynamics models (calendar and biological year approaches) differ structurally only in the treatment of the data that reveal the annual changes. The changes observed in the common sardine abundance, per calendar or biological year, indicate similar trends as those reported in earlier studies. Nevertheless, differences were registered in the estimations for both assessments, with the biological year showing lower abundance levels that are closely related to recruitment; this, considers the magnitude of the real composition of the annual class/cohort. On the other hand, the calendar year assessment incorporates the remaining annual classes/cohorts, thereby generating an erroneous estimation of the annual class/cohort abundance. The two models are compared with a likelihood indicator, finding that the assessment using the biological configuration was the best model, with a better fit to the data and greater degrees of explanation.},

These species have very similar external morphology, difficulting the species identification in the field, even for an experience scientific observer. Therefore, the aim of this work is to propose the external morphologic traits to be considered for a rapid identification of these species in the field. 60 specimens of Chilean herring and 79 Patagonian sprat were analyzed. Individuals collected were identified at the level of species and the following measurements were recorded: total length, head length, snout, eye orbital and post-orbital. Before the analysis, all measurements were standardized to avoid collinearity. Using multivariate statistics including principal component analysis, analysis of variance and covariance (ANOVA and ANCOVA), multivariate analysis of covariance (MANOVA) and linear discriminant analysis, we found that the post-orbital measurement is the morphological trait which shows the largest differentiation between species. We concluded that the post-orbital measurement is the single external morphological trait which enables a rapid identification of these species in the field. The results of this research can be taken as a baseline analysis upon the generation of field guides, and thus, supporting the species identification by scientific observers.},

abstract = {Of the four major eastern boundary currents, the Humboldt Current (HC) stands out because it is extremely productive, dominated by anchovy dynamics and subject to frequent direct environmental perturbations of the El Ni{\~{n}}o Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The long-term dynamics of the HC ecosystem are controlled by shifts between alternating anchovy and sardine regimes that restructure the entire ecosystem from phytoplankton to the top predators. These regime shifts are caused by lasting periods of warm or cold temperature anomalies related to the approach or retreat of warm subtropical oceanic waters to the coast of Peru and Chile. Phases with mainly negative temperature anomalies parallel anchovy regimes (1950-1970; 1985 to the present) and the rather warm period from 1970 to 1985 was characterized by sardine dominance. The transition periods (turning points) from one regime to the other were 1968-1970 and 1984-1986. Like an El Nino, the warm periods drastically change trophic relationships in the entire HC ecosystem, exposing the Peruvian anchovy to a multitude of adverse conditions. Positive temperature anomalies off Peru drive the anchovy population close to the coast as the coastal upwelling cells usually offer the coolest environment, thereby substantially decreasing the extent of the areas of anchovy distribution and spawning. This enhances the effects of negative density-dependent processes such as egg and larval cannibalism and dramatically increases its catchability. Increased spatial overlap between anchovies and the warmer water preferring sardines intensifies anchovy egg mortality further as sardines feed heavily on anchovy eggs. Food sources for juvenile and adult anchovies which prey on a mixed diet of phyto- and zooplankton are drastically reduced because of decreased plankton production due to restricted upwelling in warm years, as demonstrated by lower zooplankton and phytoplankton volumes and the diminution of the fraction of large copepods, their main food source. Horse mackerel and mackerel, the main predators of anchovy, increase predation pressure on juvenile and adult anchovies due to extended invasion into the anchovy habitat in warmer years. In contrast to these periods of warm and cold temperature anomalies on the decadal scale, ENSO events do not play an important role for long-term anchovy dynamics, as the anchovy can recover even from strong ENSO events within 1-2 years. Consequently, the strong 1972-1973 ENSO event (in combination with overfishing) was not the cause of the famous crash of the Peruvian anchovy fishery in the 1970s. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

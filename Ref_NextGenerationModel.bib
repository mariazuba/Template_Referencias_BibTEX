   abstract = {Fish populations with spatial structure inherently violate the assumption of a single well-mixed stock, necessitating the use of spatially-structured population dynamics models. Accounting for spatial structure accurately and easily is a major goal for the next generation of stock assessment software development. Reference points (e.g., limit or target harvest rates and their associated biomass) are inherent to stock assessments and are often calculated under equilibrium conditions. However, the calculation process can be challenging for spatially-structured population dynamics models. We outline how to calculate equilibrium quantities within spatially-structured models where density-dependence in recruitment is local. We compare those values to equivalent situations when density-dependence in recruitment is global, thereby extending the set of population dynamics models on which spatially-structured stock assessments could be based. Results suggest that our method for calculating reference points under the assumption of local density-dependence can be performed using a straightforward optimization routine, and provide clearer understanding of the effects of fishing on a spatially-structured population. Finally, we address areas of research and development needed to integrate spatially-structured population dynamics models within existing management systems.},

   abstract = {The rapid changes observed in many marine ecosystems that support fisheries pose a challenge to stock assessment and management predicated on time-invariant productivity and considering species in isolation. In single-species assessments, two main approaches have been used to account for productivity changes: allowing biological parameters to vary stochastically over time (empirical), or explicitly linking population processes such as recruitment (R) or natural mortality (M) to environmental covariates (mechanistic). Here, we describe the Woods Hole Assessment Model (WHAM) framework and software package, which combines these two approaches. WHAM can estimate time- and age-varying random effects on annual transitions in numbers at age (NAA), M, and selectivity, as well as fit environmental time-series with process and observation errors, missing data, and nonlinear links to R and M. WHAM can also be configured as a traditional statistical catch-at-age (SCAA) model in order to easily bridge from status quo models and test them against models with state-space and environmental effects, all within a single framework. We fit models with and without (independent or autocorrelated) random effects on NAA, M, and selectivity to data from five stocks with a broad range of life history, fishing pressure, number of ages, and time-series length. Models that included random effects performed well across stocks and processes, especially random effects models with a two dimensional (2D) first-order autoregressive, AR(1), covariance structure over age and year. We conducted simulation tests and found negligible or no bias in estimation of important assessment outputs (SSB, F, stock status, and catch) when the operating and estimation models matched. However, bias in SSB and F was often non-trivial when the estimation model was less complex than the operating model, especially when models without random effects were fit to data simulated from models with random effects. Bias of the variance and correlation parameters controlling random effects was also negligible or slightly negative as expected. Our results suggest that WHAM can be a useful tool for stock assessment when environmental effects on R or M, or stochastic variation in NAA transitions, M, or selectivity are of interest. In the U.S. Northeast, where the productivity of several groundfish stocks has declined, conducting assessments in WHAM with time-varying processes via random effects or environment-productivity links may account for these trends and potentially reduce retrospective bias.},

   abstract = {Considering that stock assessment requires iterative work including exploratory calculations and discussion, efficiency in completing projects is the key to a successful contribution to stock management. However, if the production speed of each process of the project is inconsistent, a faster process may be worse than a slower process because a large amount of information produced by a faster process induces human error. To coordinate the production speed of each process, we applied software development methodology to the whole assessment project, including small important tasks such as scenario selection, debugging, and yearly updates. First, we established a continuously integrated (CI) document system that monitors project files and triggers report generation when they are updated. The system is composed of four cloud services: a code hosting service, a cloud computing service, cloud storage, and a website hosting service. Because of the CI document system, all the following iterative work was reflected in the report without creating any unused output. The workflow benefited not only from the collaboration but also from the maintainability of the project because work progress and the discussion remained visible for all collaborators. We discuss the effectiveness of a workflow by Lean manufacturing that allows us to focus on the essential problem of the assessment project.},

   abstract = {Integrated analysis has increasingly been the preferred approach for conducting stock assessments and providing the basis for management advice for fish and invertebrate stocks around the world. Many decisions are required when developing integrated stock assessments. For example, the analyst needs to decide whether the model fits the data, if the optimization was successful, if estimates are consistent retrospectively, and if the model is suitable to predict future stock responses to fishing. This study provides practical guidelines for implementing selected diagnostic tools that can assist analysts in identifying problems with model specifications and alternatives that can be explored to minimize or eliminate such problems. Emphasis is placed on reviewing the implementation and interpretation of contemporary model diagnostic tools. We first describe each diagnostic approach and its utility. We then proceed by providing a “cookbook recipe” on how to implement each of the diagnostics, together with an interpretation of the results, using two worked examples of integrated stock assessments with Stock Synthesis. Further, we provide a conceptual flow chart that lays out a generic process of model development and selection using the presented model diagnostics. Based on this, we propose the following four properties as objective criteria for evaluating the plausibility of a model: (1) model convergence, (2) fit to the data, (3) model consistency, and (4) prediction skill. It would greatly benefit the stock assessment community if the next generation of stock assessment models could include the diagnostic tests presented in this study as a set of open source tools.},

   abstract = {Estimating the age composition of a fish population is a critical first step in all stock assessments that apply age-structured models. Often this is done through the use of an Age Length Key (ALK), which links a subsample of fish that have had their ages determined to those that have only had their lengths measured in order to obtain an estimate of the age structure of the entire sample. ALKs can suffer from data gaps and sampling artifacts and are limited in both how they can reflect spatial variability and how spatial information can be incorporated. We propose a novel spatial ALK model that uses an approximation of a Gaussian Field and has the ability to account for physical barriers (e.g. islands, coastlines) in the study area. Our approach is compared with a previously suggested spatial ALK model as well as non-spatial approaches using both real and simulated survey data. We find that spatial ALK approaches reduce errors in stratified estimates of abundance at age over non-spatial approaches and that incorporating physical barriers can deliver more realistic results.},

   abstract = {Within fisheries assessments, selectivity refers to the relative probability of a fish of a particular size or age being caught. Selectivity, typically modelled using a parametric function, is informed primarily by age- and size-composition data. This function can vary annually, and not accounting for this variation can result in biased estimates of abundance and mortality. Past simulation studies evaluating time-varying selectivity focused on age-structured models with little focus on size-structured models. In addition, the generating function for the size-composition data often mirrored the likelihood function. Unfortunately, this is not realistic and there is a need to determine which likelihood function is most robust. Therefore, this paper addresses two questions using simulation: (a) which is the best method for modeling time-varying selectivity and (b) which is the most robust likelihood function for size-composition data given time-varying selectivity. Both questions are addressed within the context of size-structured assessment methods. The results reveal that discrete time blocking can adequately capture time-varying selectivity. This could reduce the number of estimated parameters and hence the variance of estimated quantities. As for likelihood functions, the results reveal that the three likelihoods considered, multinomial, Dirichlet-multinomial and the multivariate normal, are all valid options. However, our preferred option is the multinomial because it has better estimates for desirable management quantities more often than the others.},

Meeting these goals requires increased efficiency at all steps in the assessment process from data processing, through model development and selection, to report writing and review. Here, we describe one widely used tool that has proven successful in increasing the efficiency of the assessment process: the r4ss package, which supports the use of the Stock Synthesis modeling framework. What began 15 years ago as a tool to provide simple model diagnostics, including plots showing data and model results, has grown into a large collection of R functions to support many aspects of the assessment process. We provide an overview of the r4ss features and illustrate its utility with examples from recent applications. Finally, we discuss lessons learned from the ongoing development of r4ss that can be applied to similar efforts associated with the next generation of stock assessment packages.},

   abstract = {Survival is an important population process in fisheries stock assessment models and is typically treated as deterministic. Recently developed state-space assessment models can estimate stochastic deviations in survival, which represent variability in some ambiguous combination of natural mortality (M), fishing mortality (F), and migration. These survival deviations are generally treated as independent by age and year, despite our understanding that many population processes can be autocorrelated and that not accounting for autocorrelation can result in notable bias. We address these concerns, as well as the strong retrospective pattern found in the last assessment of Southern New England yellowtail flounder (Limanda ferruginea), by incorporating two-dimensional (2D, age and year) first-order autocorrelation in survival and M. We found that deviations were autocorrelated among both years (0.53 ± 0.09, 0.63 ± 0.16) and ages (0.33 ± 0.12, 0.40 ± 0.16) when estimated for survival or M, respectively. Models with 2D autocorrelation on survival or M fit the data better and had reduced retrospective pattern than models without autocorrelation. The best fit model included 2D autocorrelated deviations in survival as well as independent deviations in M and altered estimates of spawning stock biomass by 18 % and F by 21 % in model years. In short-term projections with F = 0, including 2D autocorrelation in survival or M reduced spawning stock biomass by 48 %. We conclude that incorporating 2D autocorrelated variation in survival or M could improve the assessment of Southern New England yellowtail flounder in terms of model fit and consistency of biomass projections.},

   abstract = {Integrated analysis (or integrated population modelling) methods have become the preferred approach for conducting stock assessments, and providing the basis for management advice for fish and invertebrate stocks since the publication of a seminal paper by Fournier and Archibald in 1982. Methods to assess fish stocks based on single-species, single-area, age-structured models are now standard, with the major debates associated with these models related to data choice, model configuration assumptions, and data weighting. However, the current generation of stock assessment packages is not addressing all of the needs of stock assessment analysts and managers. A major challenge for any next-generation stock assessment package is the set of extensions needed to assess stocks that do not satisfy the ‘well-mixed single-stock’ paradigm. In addition, the next-generation stock assessment package needs to: (a) be able to capture age and size/stage dynamics simultaneously yet computationally efficiently, (b) scale from data-rich to data-poor, (c) include some multi-species capability, and (d) more appropriately deal with temporal variation (e.g., random effects and state-space models). In relation to data, there is a need to ensure that the next-generation stock assessment package better handles tagging data (age-size/stage models may help in this regard), in particular, to be able to use close-kin mark-recapture data. Efficient methods are needed to share parameter priors among stocks (satisfying the promise of the ‘Robin Hood’ paradigm). The next-generation stock assessment package needs to have associated appropriate training programs and documentation. Adoption of such a package will be facilitated by a data entry system that is well-documented, does not require specification of inputs that will not be used in an application, has an expert system to configure default settings based on best practices, and has associated code to automatically produce diagnostic statistics. Some technical challenges that have plagued stock assessment for decades warrant continued attention (at the theoretical and applied level) such as automatic data weighting and tuning, how to handle spatial and stock structure, improved coding to facilitate application of state-of-the-art methods for quantifying uncertainty, and adoption of true state-space formulations to allow more parameters to be treated as random effects. Future needs for features cannot be anticipated, so the key design consideration for the next-generation stock assessment package is to be flexible and modifiable to meet the requirements of analysts and users.},
